# How do I approach designing software?
# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

     The best approach I have implemented was to keep an open mind and learn as much as I can along the way
by asking for help when I need it and by researching as much as I can. I designed my landscape to try and
match my original image as best as possible. It was a good idea for me to choose objects I am able to pick up
and look at all angles as this would help me design it in a three-dimensional space. I went step by step
to try and design this scene and I feel that was a great way to go about it. In the future taking projects
one at a time could help me perfect my ideas.

# How do I approach developing programs?
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
# How did iteration factor into your development?
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

     It's important to start by defining your goals and understanding the problem you want to solve. This helps
you stay focused and have a clear direction. Plan and design your program by breaking it down into smaller, manageable
tasks. This will make the development process easier to handle. Once you have a plan, start implementing your program
using suitable programming languages and frameworks. Remember to write clean and readable code. Testing and debugging
are crucial stages to ensure your program functions correctly. Iteration plays a significant role in development as it
allows you to gather feedback and refine your program based on testing and user input. By continuously iterating, you 
can fix bugs, enhance features, and optimize performance, leading to a more robust and effective program.

     This class gave me a lot of useful skills that I will utilize in the future. Some of these skills include
perseverance, fortitude, and time management skills. I had to learn to work hard and keep figuring it out until I
understood it. I would spend hours upon hours trying to figure it out and researching to try and figure out why
a certain aspect of my program was not working. This helped me persevere and know that if I do not give up I will eventually
find the answer. This also leads me to asking for help is an important skill to have. At some point while working in this 
class I felt so lost as we learn so much each week and I had to ask for help. After having a quick conversation with my
professor he gave me the confidence and knowledge I needed to complete the project.
